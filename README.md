# Notes Management Web Application

A lightweight, responsive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built as part of a web development assessment. This application allows users to manage their daily notes with persistent storage.

## 🚀 Features

- **Create Notes:** Easily add new notes using a simple interface.
- **Display Notes:** View all saved notes in a clean, responsive card layout.
- **Edit Notes:** Update existing notes with a single click.
- **Delete Notes:** Remove notes from both the UI and local storage.
- **Persistent Storage:** Data is saved to the browser's LocalStorage, so notes remain even after refreshing the page.
- **API Integration:** Fetches a daily inspirational quote from an external API on every load.
- **Error Handling:** Form validation to prevent empty notes with visual feedback.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop views.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
- **CSS3 / Tailwind CSS:** Modern, utility-first styling and custom animations.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** DOM manipulation, Fetch API, and LocalStorage logic.
